## Welcome
My notes are put here. Hope some of them will be helpful to you!

- TODO: img reference in MagTIP is strange 
  - `![](fig/img.png)` cannot be loaded; however, in Notes/Hugo and Notes/Franklin, it is fine.
  - `![](img.png)` can be loaded
  - you have to figure this before systematically moving your notes to the `learning-notes` project
- TODO: reassign the project `using_weave`'s output
  - reassign where figures be referred (to the same place as the output `.md` for hugo.
